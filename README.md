# DLS1 - Deep Learning School (MIPT) notebooks

[🎓 DLS / MIPT]  [🧠 Deep Learning]  [📓 Notebooks]  [🖼️ Computer Vision]  [🧬 Generative]

A study project of homework notebooks completed during the **Deep Learning School** program at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT, Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics).

## ✨ Focus
Classical ML models, optimization, computer vision, and generative methods, all in practical notebook form.

## ▶️ Run
Open notebooks in Jupyter or Colab. Dependencies and run steps are described inside each notebook (some require a GPU).
